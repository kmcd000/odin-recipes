        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><h5>Make the Beets bi Tahina</h5></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Place the beets in the center of a large piece of aluminum foil. Coat the beets with the olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the water and thyme and fold the foil into a sealed packet. Put on a baking sheet and roast beets until tender, about 45-60 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Peel beets, discard thyme, and set aside to cool completely</li>
            <li>Put the beets, garlic, sesame paste, sesame seeds, lemon juice, and .5 tsp salt in a food processor and pulse to a coarse puree. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><h5>Make the Horseradish Yogurt</h5></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the Greek yogurt, horseradish, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><h5>Make the Skirt Steak</h5></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the avocado oil in a large frying pan over high heat until the oil is hot and shimmering. Carefully place one of the steaks in the pan and sear for one minute. Flip the steak and sear on the other side for one minute, then add 1 tbsp of the butter in the pan along with 3 of the thyme sprigs and 1 of the crushed garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, continuously baste the steak with the butter for 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Transfer the steak, thyme, and garlic to a plate, loosely cover with aluminum foil and let rest.</li>
            <li>Discard the used oil and butter, wipe the pan clean, and repeat steps for second steak.</li>
            <li>Let steak rest for 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut both steaks into slices across the grain and transfer to plate. Serve immediately with Beets bi Tahina and Horseradish Yogurt.</li>
